Super interested in using machine learning techniques to use AI for social good and look forward to collaborating with other interested researchers, so don't feel shy to contact me! :D

I am majoring in Computer Science at McGill University and Mila, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.reirab.com">Reihaneh Rabbnay</a> and Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/adriromsor/home">Adriana Romero-Soriano</a>.


I did my undergraduate studies at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in software engineering from 2014-2019.
