Super interested in using machine learning techniques to use AI for social good and look forward to collaborating with other interested researchers, so don't feel shy to contact me! :D

I am majoring in Computer Science at McGill University and Mila, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.reirab.com">Reihaneh Rabbnay</a> and Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/adriromsor/home">Adriana Romero-Soriano</a>.

I did my undergraduate studies at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in software engineering from 2014-2019.

My research interests are image/graph representation learning and self-supervision. My current project is on extracting multi-scale features for linking images and extracting similarities and differences among groups of images. I'm also the organizer of [Mila's Computer Vision Reading Group](https://mila-vision-rg.github.io/), if you'd like to attend or present, send me an email! :)

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)
