Super interested in using machine learning techniques to use AI for social good and constantly looking forward to collaborating with other interested researchers, so don't feel shy to contact me! :D

I am majoring in Computer Science at McGill University and Mila, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.reirab.com">Reihaneh Rabbnay</a> and Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/adriromsor/home">Adriana Romero-Soriano</a>.


My research interests are multi-modal (image/language/graph) representation learning and self-supervision in general.
I am currently a visiting researcher at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) and working on and exploring open- and closed-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to see how reliable they are as judges.


Furthermore, I am further interested in how self-supervised methods can enhance their robustness in uni- or multi-modal learning, enabling them to perform effectively across a broader spectrum of applications and real-world datasets.


<!-- My current project is on extracting multi-scale features for linking images and extracting similarities and differences among groups of images. -->
I'm also the founder of [Mila's Computer Vision Reading Group](https://mila-vision-rg.github.io/) (currently on pause). If you'd like to attend or present something, send me an email! :)
