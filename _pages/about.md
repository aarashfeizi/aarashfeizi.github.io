Super interested in using machine learning techniques to use AI for social good and constantly looking forward to collaborating with other interested researchers, so don't feel shy to contact me! :D -->

I'm passionate about multimodal learning and large multimodal models, exploring their applications (and limitations) in real-world scenarios. Always open to collaborating with like-minded researchers, so don't feel shy to contact me!

I am majoring in Computer Science at McGill University and Mila, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.reirab.com">Reihaneh Rabbany</a> and Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/adriromsor/home">Adriana Romero-Soriano</a>.


My research interests are multi-modal (image/language/graph) representation learning and self-supervision in general.

I recently started as a Student Researcher at [Google Research](https://research.google), where I'm working on projects involving text-to-image models and data attribution.

Previously, I was a visiting researcher at [ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/research/), where I designed novel multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and explored how open- and closed-source MLLMs perform as reliable judges. Before that, I interned at [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com/), working on multimodal learning for biological data.


Furthermore, I am also interested in how self-supervised methods can enhance their robustness in uni- or multi-modal learning, enabling them to perform effectively across a broader spectrum of applications and real-world datasets.


<!-- My current project is on extracting multi-scale features for linking images and extracting similarities and differences among groups of images. -->
Finally, I'm the founder of [Mila's Computer Vision Reading Group](https://mila-vision-rg.github.io/) (currently on pause). If you'd like to attend or present something, send me an email! :)
