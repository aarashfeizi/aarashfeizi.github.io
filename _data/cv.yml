    - title: Guided Positive Sampling for Self-Supervised Learning
      year: 2023
      items:
        - Designed a novel method, namely GPS-SSL, for integrating a priori knowledge into any self-supervised learning (SSL) model
        - GPS-SSL performs positive sampling by approximating strong augmentations 
        - The method encourages the base SSL method to be more robust against untuned data augmentations when applied to under-studied and/or real-world datasets
        - Submitted to ICLR 2023

      items:
        - Revisited two image datasets, Hotels-50K and Hotel-ID, and proposed new training
          and evaluation splits with different levels of difficulty
        - Proposed evaluation splits based on the images' class and super-class information
          to imitate real-world scenarios

        - Studied salary trends and found similar trend patterns exclusive to a few occupation sectors
        - Used the Jensen–Shannon divergence between salary trends to construct a salary-similarity-network across employees in different sectors
        - Built a multipartite graph from the employers and found meaningful employer embeddings
